<span style="color: violet">A link at the bottom of your game with the <strong>seed</strong> will provide a link for the <i>exact same</i> dungeon. Send it to your friends, or try and beat your old fastest run!</span>

<h2>Story</h2>
<p>
The gods have gone mad and has tormented your people long enough. It's up to you to enter their temple, make your way to the top, and destroy them.
To accomplish this, you have been given a magical axe. It is capable of destroying anything - mortal or immortal. The downside... it is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9KbmRTgigQ">heavy as f***</a>.
</p>

<h2>Gameplay and tactics</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You deal <strong>Stamina</strong> damage per attack, with a minimum of 1</li>
	<li>All monsters do 1 damage, unless specified otherwise</li>
	<li>Pay attention to the maximum health of incoming monsters (right side), don't get trapped! You can't afford to waste turns taking damage</li>
	<li>While carrying the axe, each step will drain your limited stamina. Since stamina determines the amount of damage you do, you must manage your steps carefully.</li>
	<li>Use every trick in the book to taunt, cajole, trap, teleport,  or otherwise draw out your enemies into your attacks.</li>
	<li>Every time you strike down an enemy, your stamina replenishes fully... use this to chain as many attacks together as possible. (Without getting hit of course)</li>
	<li>You can drop the Axe and move without losing stamina. Activating a Rune of Recall or reading a Scroll of Recall will summon the Axe back to you, smiting any enemies in the way. The axe will deal up to six damage, depending on how far it travels (more distance = more damage). </li>
	<li>For tougher enemies, Recall will be a necessity if you want to kill them without being hit, because they have more than six health!</li>
	<li>Advance to the next level by defeating all enemies</li>
	<li>Taunting has a maximum effective distance. It will taunt <i>all</i> enemies equally, so be careful who you are waking up!</li>
	<li>You can watch me beat <a href="http://heroicfisticuffs.com/heavyaxe/index.html?seed=231021440">this seed</a> in <a href="http://youtu.be/RS7ug7yYrBU">this youtube video</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Scrolls</h2>
<p>You can pick these up and use them via the hotkeys 1-9.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Scroll of <strong>Recall</strong> - Summons the Axe back to your possession, damaging any enemies along the way (think Thor's hammer, only text-based). The further it travels, the more damage it will do, up to a maximum of six. </li>
	<li>Scroll of <strong>Teleport</strong> - Teleports you to a (supposedly) safe space on the level</li>
	<li>Scroll of <strong>Sacrifice</strong> - Refills your stamina completely at the cost of 1 health. However, the scroll cannot kill you by taking your final health point</li>
	<li>Scroll of <strong>Shield</strong> - Gives you a protective shield good against one hit. Does not stack.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Runes</h2>
<p>Runes are activated by standing on them and <strong>REST</strong>ing</p>
<ul>
	<li>Rune of <strong>Recall</strong> - Same as a Scroll of Recall, except the rune is inexhaustible</li>
	<li>Rune of <strong>Health</strong> - Will restore one health when activated, and then disappear. An invaluable rune.</li>
	<li>Rune of <strong>Portal</strong> - All Runes of Portal are connected in pairs. Activating the rune will teleport you between them. What happens if an enemy gets in the way?</li>
</ul>

<h2>7DRL Version Comments</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Sorry about the terrible inventory, I could not figure out an elegant solution to having a smaller font.</li>
	<li>The on-screen messages are mostly a temporary/necessary evil, they will be replaced as soon as I can figure out an elegant message buffer</li>
